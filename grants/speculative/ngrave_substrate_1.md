# NGRAVE Wallet Substrate Integration 

## Project Description
The goal of NGRAVE is to create a fully integrated, end-to-end security solution for all aspects relating to security on the blockchain. From wallet generation, to wallet management, and secure key storage to posthumous recovery and more, NGRAVE's goal is to offer the highest level of security. 

Central to this endeavour is our flagship product, the NGRAVE ZERO. It is a versatile hardware wallet with a novel key creation procedure, fingerprint authentication, and touchscreen display. It has been given incubator support and is being built by belgium's own IMEC. 

Impeccable security is a requirement. The Polkadot ecosystem needs a wallet management solution that can compete with the best industry standards currently available for other blockchains, and we want to build it. Without good security there are hard limitations on adoption, especially in order to get institutional support.

**Our interest is twofold:**
1. It is exciting to help pioneer solutions while the technology is still new and thus creates a more meaningful impact. 
2. A single substrate integration will allow us to offer support for any substrate derived chain.

As it stands, besides the Parity Signer we have no knowledge of other hardware wallets that already have or are planning on adding substrate support. We would like to remedy that.

All code we would develop for this project would be open source and reusable for other projects, as our main goal is to increase adoption signing by QR code.

### Legal Structure

- Incorporated in Belgium as NGRAVE.IO NV

### Team’s experience
The team is highly complementary, jointly having a worldwide network in crypto, and over 20,000 hours of project management experience in launching new tech projects from ideation to post go-live.

Our CEO Ruben Merre has a comprehensice background in strategy, management, and innovation consulting. Prior to NGRAVE he lead a multi-million-dollar program to build a new group-wide automated investment business unit for the top financial institution KBC, consisting of 20 subprojects including all business and ICT tracks. He is well-versed in growth strategies, go to market, marketing & sales, and business development.

Our COO Edouard Vanham bridges the technical and business aspects, leveraging his expertise as a former IT and Management consultant, where he led several digitization projects in the banking and insurance industry.

Our CTO Xavier Hendrickx has been in the crypto space for a long time and was CTO of the Belgo-American top blockchain project SwarmCity, which he ultimately left for a full-time position at NGRAVE.

NGRAVE has many experienced advisors including business veterans, sales & general managers, sales leaders, serial entrepreneurs, company founders, and financial leaders.

Our manufacturing partner in both hardware and firmware is IMEC: the world leader in R&D for nanotechnology and digital technologies (such as battery-, sensor, IoT-technology) and a leading micro/nano chip manufacturer.

## Intended language of development
* C++ 

## Development Roadmap
#### Milestones:

We will require 4-6 months to complete the proposed milestones.

1. Milestone 1 (4-6 weeks): R & D, identifying libraries, defining exact seed derivation scheme, integration of libraries into firmware for Ristretto compressed Ed25519, with WIP documentation as it pertains to NGRAVE. 

2. Milestone 2 (4-6 weeks): Implement C++ code into NGRAVE Zero using information gained from R & D milestone above. 

3. Milestone 3 (2-4 week): Finalize the documentation of NGRAVE’s integration and publish under MIT license,  showcasing the first hardware solution with a seed derivation scheme for a wallet. 

Once the milestones have been delivered, it is our intention to address the next steps towards creating a fully functional integration. This includes things like account creation, account management, transaction signing, message signing, contract calls, and various other functions as needed.
