# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** NFT Parachain

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

#### Brief Description

NFT Parachain is a Substrate based blockchain made for handling Non Fungible Token (NFT) collections. It includes NFT Pallet that allows creating collections of unique things, minting tokens, and managing transfers, provides ERC-721 and ERC-1155 functionality, and many more features.

The POC of NFT Chain was delivered during Hackusama hackaphon. More information is availabe in (this delivery walk-through document)[https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain/blob/master/doc/hackusama_walk_through.md].

The source code for the POC is available in this repository: https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain

#### How NFT Parchain Integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama

NFT Chain is based on Substrate (currently a modified version of RC4 release). The plan is to integrate into Kusama (and further in Polkadot) ecosystem as a parachain and provide NFT functionality to all parachains in the network.

#### Why Is My Team Interested

We see Polkadot as a very promissing technology that will be used for a large number of use cases. It will greatly contribute to adoption of blockchain in powerful applications. It is technically one of the most ambitious blockchain projects we know of, and we would like to be part of the community that's creating it, as well as developing on it once the network goes live.

In particular, NFT technology are a great part of our roadmap, which includes integration with Gaming frameworks, building gaming APIs, wallets, etc. NFT Tracking Module will enable next steps in this roadmap such as bridges to other networks, NFT exchange, etc.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features
...

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:
* What work has been done so far?
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
* Have you applied for other grants so far?
