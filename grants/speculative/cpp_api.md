# Polkadot C++ API

## Project Description


### Brief Description
Polkadot integration C++ API for Substrate allows to read chain information and state, block details, as well as sign and publish transactions in C++. It also allows to subscribe to substrate node websocket endpoints and receive data updates.

POC is available here: https://github.com/usetech-llc/polkadot_api_cpp

### Why C++ API is Good for the Ecosystem
While high quality well documented APIs help community integrate with products in general, C++ API will be especially helpful for financial sector as well as gaming industry. Financial companies are looking more and more towards crypto markets, and gaming assets become tokenized in the form of miscellaneous types of tokens, frequently cross-chain. Because of their high performance requirements, both industries historically accumulated large code bases in C++, so this API aims to greatly facilitate adoption of Polkadot for them.

### How C++ API Integrates into Substrate
Substrate provides secure WebSocket endpoints, which are used directly by C++ API.

### Why our Team is Interested
We see Polkadot as a very promissing technology that will be used for a large number of use cases. It will greatly contribute to adoption of blockchain in powerful applications. It is technically one of the most ambitious blockchain projects we know of, and we would like to be part of the community that's creating it, as well as developing on it once the network goes live. This proposal is just the first step in creating what we hope will be a large Polkadot team.

## Development Roadmap
Project roadmap and financial plan will be shared privately via Google Form.

Long term plans start with developing APIs for all mainstream languages as well as in-depth API improvement. As Polkadot community high level usecases evolve, API will adapt.

Also, our team plans to implement broader spectrum of applications such as
* Decentralized Non-Fungible Token Exchange
* Multi-chain token issuance
* Cross-chain Payment Gateways
* etc.

## Additional Information

### What work has been done so far?
Proof of concept C++ API has been done, which successfully establishes connection to a public substrate node and retrieves a JSON string for method chain_getRuntimeVersion. Source code and preliminary documentation is available at this public repository:
https://github.com/usetech-llc/polkadot_api_cpp

### Are there any other projects similar to yours? How is our project different?
So far there has only been JavaScript API project: https://polkadot.js.org/api/

Other mainstream languages are not yet covered. Our plan is to start with C++ and cover all mainstream languages/stacks such as Python, C#, Java, etc. We believe that having a wide coverage will greatly improve adoption of Polkadot among the software developers.
