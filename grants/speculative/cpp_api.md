# Polkadot C++ API

## Project Description


### Brief Description
Polkadot integration C++ API for Substrate allows to read chain information and state, block details, as well as sign and publish transactions in C++. It also allows to subscribe to substrate node websocket endpoints and receive data updates.

### Why C++ API is Good for the Ecosystem
While high quality well documented APIs help community integrate with products in general, C++ API will be especially helpful for financial sector as well as gaming industry. Financial companies are looking more and more towards crypto markets, and gaming assets become tokenized in the form of miscellaneous types of tokens, frequently cross-chain. Because of their high performance requirements, both industries historically accumulated large code bases in C++, so this API aims to greatly facilitate adoption of Polkadot for them.

### How C++ API Integrates into Substrate
Substrate provides secure WebSocket endpoints, which are used directly by C++ API.

### Why our Team is Interested
We see Polkadot as a very promissing technology that will be used for a large number of use cases. It will greatly contribute to adoption of blockchain in powerful applications. It is technically one of the most ambitious blockchain projects we know of, and we would like to be part of the community that's creating it, as well as developing on it once the network goes live. This proposal is just the first step in creating what we hope will be a large Polkadot team.

## Development Roadmap
Please add information setting into sufficient detail the following (usually two pages):

* The specifications of the software, delivered over a number of milestones. The detail must be such that after delivery we are able to examine whether the software meets the requirements agreed in the specifications, in order to be able to make any payments to you.
* A time schedule on when each milestone will be achieved.
* The required grant per milestone and the total amount requested. Grants can be in one of the fiat currencies CHF, EUR or USD or in DOTs or a combination of fiat and DOTs. Please reach out to grants@web3.foundation for discussing what amount in fiat and DOTs would be appropriate.
* Note that we now have a preference to collect the financial information via our Google Form, or via a Google Document (paste the link into our Google Form).


Note: It should be clear how the project will be working towards deployment on Substrate / Polkadot.

Also helpful to know: what are the teamâ€™s long-term plans and intentions after the grant has been awarded?
