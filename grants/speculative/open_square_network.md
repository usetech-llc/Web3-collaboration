# Project name
Open Square Network

## Project Description
Open Square Network is a blockchain based crowdsourcing and reputation platform. It will be implemented as a para-chain
of Polkadot. We aim to attract thousands of middle and small sized enterprises and millions of developers in China for the first phase. 
This platform is a trial to evolve the human resource market. First phase features include:
- Bounty funders can fund a bounty, while hunters can apply it.
- Funders can get mining powers by successful collaboration with hunters.
- Reputation of both funders and hunters will be calculated based on the finished bounty and remarks.
- Aim to maintain relatively long collaboration between bounty funders and hunters.

## Development Roadmap
`The Open Square Network MVP` will be a 3-month project, aiming to deliver a testnet based on Substrate which support basic business for bounty founders and hunters.

* **M1: Economic/reputation model, technical design (2 weeks)**
  - We will create and publish relevant documents and whitepapers.
  - Design the native currency distribution model for the chain participators(validators, bounty funders and hunters).
    - Validators' reward model will be relatively stable.
    - Several candidate reward models will be apply to keep funders and hunters from cheating to get higher reputation.
  - Technical specifications and modules design.
  - DApp UX design.
  
* **M2: Implementation of the runtime modules (1 month)**
  - Native asset module, which will support transfer, staking, while chain dividends amount will be decided by native asset holdings.
  - Bounty management module. A basic user story will be:
    1. Funders create bounty.
    2. Chain council(Fixed members for the MVP version) may give some feedback and do some management for the bounty.
    3. Hunters apply and resolve it.
    4. Hunters get funding and the council get some management fee.
    5. Successive mining powers will be assigned to funders and hunters.
  - Reputation module mainly manage funders and hunters' reputation based on the collaboration remarks.
  
* **M3: Implementation of the DAPPs, explorer and user manual (6 weeks)**
  - A DAPP will be delivered to facilitate bounty funders and hunters to finish the basic business.
  - The chain explorer will be provided for blocks/extrinsic explorer.
  - The testnet will be launched with the DAPPs and explorer.
  - User manuals will be provided.
  

## Future Plans
* Build the identity system for users.
* Polkadot para-chain assets will be introduced as bounty currency.
* More PR work will be done to attract bounty founders and hunters.
* Our vision is to build a new block chain human resource platform involve crowdsourcing, reputation building, recruitment.

## Additional Information
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Several google docs below will be helpful for you to understand our ideas.
1. [[OSN] Why](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozwyhQ7g0UabVny5g-uF5z9TC8hya5yhVDz-SVreDek/edit?usp=sharing) shows why we have the idea to build Open Square Network.
2. [[OSN] How](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hhAyEixHa-qfMiv-6mf2Fk5EVPSTns9Ehv-EZ3_Dj3g/edit?usp=sharing) shows some details about the reputation score calculation.

Possible additional information to include:
* What work has been done so far?  
  1. We have drafted the basic economic model. More details about the model and technical specifications will be done in future work.
  2. We have enough experience with Substrate for development of [ChainX](https://github.com/chainx-org). 
* Are there any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?  
No
* Have you applied for other grants so far?  
No
* Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?  
Some of our ideas are inspired by [Gitcoin Bouties](https://gitcoin.co/bounties/funder). Main differences are:
  - Open Square Network will support relatively long time collaboration between bounty funders and hunters.
  - A separate Polkadot para chain will be developed to support the business and reduce the friction for users.
  - Bounty funders and hunters can get financial reward by mining.   
  - Both the reputation of funders and hunters will be built.
  - On-chain governance will be built to provide more fairness and transparency.
