# Project Name
VSCode Plugin

## Project Description
This is an application for development of a plugin/extension for the VSCode editor. The web3 team has expressed a need for such a plugin instead of a full-blown IDE.

* The main goal of the project is to simplify the process of development and eliminate redundant work.
* The plugin will help developers to check the transactions types and inputs on various chains, it will also enable to quickly check if the transaction will be executed on the blockchain correctly and highlight any possible bugs in the code.
* We see great potential in the project and are ready to help with our expertise and knowledge in the domain of software engineering.

## Team members
* Vitalii Parkhomenko – team leader/researcher/tech writer
* Aleksei Korobeinikov – developer

## Team Website
* https://everstake.one & https://atticlab.net  

## Legal Structure 
ATTIC LAB, Limited Liability Company. 89, Kazimir Malevich str., Kyiv, 03150, Ukraine

## Team's experience
Everstake is an affiliate company of Attic Lab, so members from both teams are going to participate in the project.
Everstake has developed an online IDE for the IOST blockchain and the link was shared with the team.
Attic Lab’s development experience includes the following projects:
Crypto exchange Codex. View Here
Cassandra history plugin. View Here
Munin plagins. View Here
OpenBankIT. Open-source banking software. View Here
EOS History API running on Elasticsearch cluster. View Here

## Development Roadmap

*  Milestone 1 – VSCode. Working with transactions – 28 working days – 100 DOT
   *  VS Code plugin/extension is represented in the form of a sidebar with control panel. 
   *  The plugin will allow users to:
      *  install a local Substrate node,
      *  setup a development chain,
      *  start/stop the development chain,
      *  clear the chain data (for restarting chain from genesis),
      *  manage accounts,
      *  send test extrinsics.
      *  view output logs
   *  The extension parses node config and recognizes extrinsics types (transactions or inherents) and inputs from a given chain. The control panel allows developers to send transactions to the chain and see logs and returned results from the executed transactions.
   *  Documentation: we will create a short tutorial that describes how to setup and use the plugin.
   *  Documentation: we will write documentation that describes the functionality of the plugin.
   *  Documentation: we will include detailed instructions on compiling and running the plugin, including a Docker container with all dependencies.

 
 
*  Milestone 2 – Smart-Contracts – 15 working days – 7000 USD
   *  The plugin contains controls for deploying and calling smart-contracts in a current development chain.
   *  User interface to easily list and send extrinsics.
   *  The plugin enables verification of extrinsics by checking for critical bugs. The choice of static analysis tool will be determined during the first week of milestone #1.
   *  Documentation: A new tutorial will be created to guide users through the new features.
   *  Documentation: we will write documentation that describes the new functionality that we added to the plugin.

*  Milestone 3 – Atom. Working with extrinsics & smart contracts – 18 working days - 7000 USD
   *  Atom plugin/extension is represented in the form of a sidebar with control panel. 
   *  The plugin will allow users to:
      *  install a local Substrate node,
      *  setup a development chain,
      *  start/stop the development chain,
      *  clear the chain data (for restarting chain from genesis),
      *  manage accounts,
      *  send test extrinsics,
      *  view output logs.

* Note that we now have a preference to collect the financial information via our Google Form, or via a Google Document (paste the link into our Google Form).




## Long-term plans
We would like to continue developing tools and products for Polkadot, and not only in the area of editors and IDE’s.
